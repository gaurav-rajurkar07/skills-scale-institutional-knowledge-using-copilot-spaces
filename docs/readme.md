# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to OctoAcme's program management documentation. This repository centralizes our approach, key artifacts, and processes, making it easier for all team members to collaborate, onboard, and continuously improve.

## Summary of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme follows an **iterative, customer-first approach** to project management, emphasizing clear roles, risk management, and continuous improvement. 

### Core Principles
- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning

### Project Lifecycle
Our projects progress through six key phases:

1. **Initiation** — Validate business need, align stakeholders, create a lightweight plan
2. **Planning** — Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks
3. **Execution & Tracking** — Build, test, review, and iterate with daily standups and demos
4. **Risk Management & Communication** — Identify and monitor risks, maintain stakeholder alignment
5. **Release & Deployment** — Deploy to production with smoke tests and rollback plans
6. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** — Capture learnings and drive iterative improvements

### Key Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features and collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs and approvals
